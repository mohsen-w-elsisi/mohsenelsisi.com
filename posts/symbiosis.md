We all know how teamwork is so amazing, right? Well, what if we extend
this idea further from just your classmates in the room or your
co-workers on the team to include the whole internet? This might not be
possible in your job, because you might work in a large company, or
produce an asset that is not so easily digitised, but what this does
apply to is software. Let's first take a step back and identify what is
so great about teamwork in the first place.

## Why is teamwork so effective?

When you have multiple people on a team they are given the freedom to
each do the thing they're really good at. The freedom to *specialise.*
The designer can work on the packaging of the product, while the
engineer figures out how it's gonna be made in the first place. If one
person was responsible for both engineering and designing then he
wouldn't do as good a job as two experts who can fully dedicate
themselves to mastering their fields.

So as developers we should do the same thing, because while you might
think programming is one field, it's really not. If you were building a
mobile app you could specialise in animation, accessibility or
preformance (making it faster).

That's if you're making a basic app. You get more specialisations for
more specific requirements, for example an app connecting a smart watch
to your smartphone needs someone who knows how to use bluetooth.

If you had one guy who was responsible for giving the app fluid
animations, bringing it up to speed with accessibility standards,
optimising it not to use too much battery power, and building a system
on top of bluetooth to communicate with the smart watch, then you
wouldn't have a good app.

## A few real world examples.

to make the software running on a playstation is no simple task, and i'm
not talking about the games. The base system has to insure that:

-   when you click the button, the thing powers on.
-   when you select a game, it launches.
-   when the game hits a bug and crashes, it doesn't crash the whole
    system with it.
-   A hundred other things

So did Sony build all of that themselves? Of course they didn't. there
is a project called openBSD that already does a lot of the basic stuff.
Playstation developers just built on top of open BSD, so now they could
focus on the more niche parts of the playstation operating system.

A similar story happened with android. Google didn't build the operating
system from the ground up, but used the linux project as a starting
point. Linux also offered a lot of the basic needs of an operating
system. Google developers then focused on (for example) programming
touch controls. Something very niche to a smartphone operating system.

Android wouldn't have been released with the feature set that it did if
there hadn't been symbiosis between the developers of the linux project
and android.
