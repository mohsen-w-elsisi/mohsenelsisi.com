title: Can We Have Digital Governmental IDs Instead of Cards?

I recently turned 16 (happy birthday to me 🥳). This meant I needed to
get my governmental ID made since I live in Egypt. unfortunately, It's
not a pleasant process, in fact it's quite annoying 🙄. I have to be at
a government facility, and it won't get made until I'm done waiting for
what feels like forever, and even then I still have to deal with all the
employees there who'll send me from counter to counter aimlessly. There
must be a better way! Like hotel bookings and bank transactions, can't
this be digital as well?

## Our current system

I already told you about how IDs are made. There are three problems i
see with it:

1.  You have to be on premises
2.  You have to wait in a long queue
3.  You have to deal with (what i've been told are) annoying employees
    looking for a bribe

Now once you have an ID, you should be extra careful not to lose it,
since it's the only thing that confirms that you should exist. To make
sure this isn't someone else's card, there is a photo on the ID that can
verify your identity if needed.

When creating any government documents or when signing contracts, your
ID's number is used to make sure you approved of this document or
operation.

For example: if you sign on a document stating a bank transaction, then
your ID number will also be included on the document . This keeps anyone
else from assuming your identity and singing with your name, thus
performing an operation on your behalf that you don't allow.

This also means that your ID number MUST remain a secret. This isn't a
very reliable system. If someone just looks over your shoulder (spotting
your ID number) and looks like you, then for all the government knows,
they're you.

## We already have digital IDs

You probably have a google account. That account identifies you not just
when using google services, but also with any app that asks you to "sign
in with Google". So your google account is a digital ID.

We do really serious stuff with these accounts already. Your google
account is linked to Google pay, which lets you perform credit card
transactions.

Your account is also super secure. It uses multi-factor authentication,
which means that just knowing the password isn't enough sometimes.

## why a digital system of government IDs might be better than what we have now

First and foremost, it would end the main annoyance I talked about at
the beginning. If IDs were digital then there would be no need to be on
prem (unless maybe biometrics were needed) when making your ID.

Operations would be done much faster, because they'll be done by
computers instead of people. And speaking of people, employees will
almost be completely eradicated from the system, except maybe for
support in case someone doesn't understand what they should be doing.

Identity fraud would become less of a problem. No one can peek over your
shoulder and steal your identity, because these digital systems can use
multi-factor authentication.

For example requiring you to sign with your finger print and your
password. Or maybe the card could be scanned (sorta like a credit card)
and your fingerprint could be read and a password could be put in. all
that could be sent over to triple check you're who you say you are!

Or we could get rid of the card entirely and have it work like logging
in with an online account: just a name and a password and maybe a code
sent to you with SMS.

You might think the things I listed above might take a lot of time, but
they don't. How much time does it take for you to unlock your phone with
your fingerprint? How much time does it take to login with your
account's password? How much time does it take you to put the credit
card inside a credit card reader. Almost none!

## Is that secure?

**Short answer**: yes!

**Long answer**: if data is transferred over the internet, then an
idntity could be fabricated using a special type of computer called a
\_quantum computer. \_These new computers basically break our current
systems of authentication on the internet, so they can commit identity
fraud. That being said though, there are new algorithms which are immune
to quantum computers. We can use them instead.

## What india's done

In response to a lot of Indians not having an ID, India created a system
of digital identification called the *aadhaar*. The Aadhaar is a system
used by 1.3 billion indians. It connects a citizen's basic information
and biometrics with a 12 digit code. This id can be used for
registration of services like banks for example.

## Conclusion

Current governmental ID systems are annoying. A digital system of
identification would be faster, less annoying and more secure. If such a
system is used, then modern algorithms must be used to avoid the threat
of quantum computers. India is a great example of how digital
governmental IDs can be used IRL.
